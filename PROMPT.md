## here are some features i would like you to implement

# albums tab

- remove element showing number of tracks inside album
- album sort options should be: title, artist, date

# artists tab

- only in list view

# tracks tab

- remove go to album, artist and info options from the 3 dot menu
- remove track number from sort options

# album overview

- only sort by track number, no other sort options needed
- add a formatted string like "15 Tracks" in a smaller font under the album name to show number of tracks inside the album

# now playing

- remove the 3 dot menu, replace it with Add to playlist option, as i do not need other options.
- clicking on artist name should take you to that artist's page.
- clicking on the album cover should take you to that albums page.
- add a 3rd option for one-shotting the whole queue. current options are only repeat single track, or repeat the whole queue

# settings - theme

- theme only works when selected to system default. for example when device is set to dark mode, selecting neither light mode, or AMOLED black works as intended. this should be fixed
